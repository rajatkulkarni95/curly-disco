*As deemed by ChatGPT,* some potential features of a note-taking app based on the Zettelkasten method.

1. **Flexible organization**: The Zettelkasten method is known for its flexibility in organizing notes. A great feature for a note-taking app would be the ability to easily organize notes by tags, categories, and/or keywords.

2. **Linked notes**: In a Zettelkasten system, notes are often linked together via references and connections. A note-taking app could have a feature that allows users to easily link their notes together.

3. **Search function**: With a large number of notes, it can be easy to forget where a specific note is located. A search feature that scans all notes could be helpful in quickly finding the right note.

4. **Interoperability**: If a Zettelkasten note-taking app is used for academic or research purposes, it would be useful if the app could integrate with other software such as reference managers and citation generators.

5. **Mobile accessibility**: Many individuals like the portability of note-taking apps. A mobile-friendly app would be a great feature for users who wish to take their notes on the go.

6. **Version control**: Researchers and scholars often iterate on their ideas and notes. A version control feature would allow users to capture and track changes made to their notes over time.

7. **Automations**: Automations could help users easily create new notes and tags or link related notes together. This could save time and reduce the cognitive load of note-taking.

8. **Collaboration**: Many researchers and scholars collaborate with others on their work. A collaboration feature could allow users to share notes and feedback, working on a project collectively.

9. **Export and backup**: To avoid the risk of losing important data, an export and backup feature could be very useful. This would allow users to export their notes in various formats and keep a backup of their data to prevent data loss.

10. **Security**: Privacy and security are important considerations for any note-taking app. Features such as two-factor authentication, password protection, and end-to-end encryption would ensure the safety of users' notes.
