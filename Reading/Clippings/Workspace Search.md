# Workspace Search

![](https://docs.octarine.app/api/og?title=Workspace+Search&description=Quickly+find+and+navigate+to+any+note+in+your+workspace)

Workspace Search helps you find notes instantly by searching through titles, content, and tags. Located at the top of the sidebar, just below the workspace selector, it's always within reach.

### [Opening Search](#opening-search)

-   **Click** the search field in the sidebar, or
-   **Press** `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F` from anywhere

### [How It Works](#how-it-works)

As you type, results appear in real time. Click any result to open the note—Octarine will automatically launch in-file search with your query, highlighting all matches within the document.

**Search options:**

-   **Full-text search** — Search across note titles and content
-   **Tag search** — Use hashtags to filter by tags (e.g., `#project`)
-   **Regex** — Enable regular expressions for advanced pattern matching
-   **Match word** — Restrict results to complete word matches (compatible with regex)
-   **Match case** — Enable case-sensitive matching (compatible with regex)
-   **Search in** — Narrow your search to specific areas like Daily Desk or Templates

### [Understanding Results](#understanding-results)

Results display the note title with matching terms highlighted, along with a content preview showing where your query appears. Opening a result preserves your search filters, so in-file search continues with the same criteria.

**Keyboard navigation:**

-   `↑` `↓` — Move through results
-   `Enter` — Open selected note
-   `Escape` — Clear search and dismiss results
