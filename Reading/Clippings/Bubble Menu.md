The bubble menu is your quick-access formatting toolbar that appears when you select text. It puts the most common formatting options right at your fingertips.

### [How to Use the Bubble Menu](#how-to-use-the-bubble-menu)

1.  **Select any text** in your note by clicking and dragging
2.  The bubble menu automatically appears above your selection
3.  Click any button to apply formatting
4.  The menu disappears when you click elsewhere

### [Available Formatting Options](#available-formatting-options)

The bubble menu includes these formatting tools:

-   All Basic formatting tools
-   **Highlight** - Apply background highlighting
    -   This is a dropdown that allows you to set a color for the highlight. Clicking on the same color on a highlighted text, de-highlights it.
-   **Add to Chat** - Adds the selected text to the Writing Assistant as context.
-   **Create linked note from selection** - Creates a note with the text selected (if it doesn’t contain invalid characters) and auto links it.

### [When the Bubble Menu Won't Appear](#when-the-bubble-menu-wont-appear)

The bubble menu doesn't appear when:

-   You're in a code block
-   You're editing a table cell

Some bubble menu buttons will be hidden when under bullet list, numbered list or task lists like - Header, Callout, Codeblock, Quote since those can’t be assigned to a list item.
