**Welcome to Octarine :)**

Is this the 1857345th Note Editing app out there? Maybe? Would I be making promises, that this one is *different*? Haven’t you heard that before?

Octarine is a lot of things, `fundamentally new` is not one of them, and you know what - **That’s fine**!

It does all the usual things that you’d expect from a note taker, but takes a few workflows that seemed to work with me, and gives it a try.

- **Private and Local by Default**

  - No **vendor lock-in**. All notes are stored locally on your disk, in `Markdown` format, so if you ever feel like Octarine isn’t the one (we hope you don’t), you’d not be losing your notes, and you can just take them to the next lovely app out there!

  - Nothing touches our servers. Your notes live in your disk, only for your eyes.

- **Multiple Workspaces**

  For when Work and Personal, need to separated. Create as many workspaces as you want, they are just folders on your disk! Customise name, color, theme and settings for each workspace, so you can truly separate them

- **Daily Desk**

  Not everything needs to be a long thought of note. Sometimes you just want to jot down what you want to do for the day. We get it, we just like you. Head over to daily desk, create notes and view them in that slick calendar

  `Tip` - Every day on the calendar that has a note with it, has a small **dot** to signify it at a quick glance
