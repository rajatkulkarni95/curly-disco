### Main Takeaways:

- **Profitable Trade**: On April 9, 2025, a trader risked $2.5 million on zero-day options for SPY and made over $70 million in about an hour due to precise timing and market movement.

- **Option Details**: The trader purchased call options allowing the right to buy SPY at $509/share while SPY was trading below $500, with options expiring the same day, indicating a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

- **Market Reaction**: The market spiked after Donald Trump announced a pause on tariffs just after the options were purchased, which led to a rapid increase in SPY's price and the value of the options.

- **High Volume Trades**: Approximately 30,000 contracts changed hands in this singular event, and trading volume dramatically increased, indicating unusual activity and potential pre-positioning by the trader.

- **Comparison to Historical Events**: This event was atypical compared to previous market shocks where trading volumes were flat before announcements, suggesting the trader may have acted on insider information.

- **Uncertainty and Speculation**: The identity of the trader and the source of their information is unknown, raising questions about whether the successful trade was based on speculation or inside knowledge.
